# FestDelivery

My first Android Project, made for the 2018 TCC of the Systems Analysis and Development course at UNISALESIANO university in Ara√ßatuba - SP, Brazil.
The application used the retrofit library to make requests in a REST API and create an e-commerce for fast delivery products.

### Libraries that were used in the project::
 - Retrofit
